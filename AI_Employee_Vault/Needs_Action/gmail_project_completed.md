## Email Content

Hi,

I'm pleased to inform you that the AI Employee Dashboard project has been completed successfully. The team is very happy with the results.

Could you please send us the final invoice for this project? I believe this was for 20 hours of consulting services at $100/hour, so the total should be $2,000.

Please send the invoice to our accounting department at accounting@abccorp.com so we can process payment.

Thanks again for the great work!

Best regards,
John Smith
ABC Corp
